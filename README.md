💫 About Me:

Hey there! I'm Leidy Rodriguez, an Industrial Engineer and passionate data enthusiast with a knack for turning numbers into stories. I believe that data has the power to drive smarter decisions, and I’m here to make that happen!

With a background in data analysis and project management, I thrive on finding insights hidden in data and sharing them in a way that’s easy to understand and act on. I love using tools like Power BI, Excel, and SQL to dig deep, spot trends, and help teams see the big picture. Whether it's helping businesses understand their customers or optimizing inventory levels, I’m all about using data to make a difference.

🌟 What I bring to the table:

Expertise in Power BI and Excel for data visualization and reporting
Hands-on experience in data validation and dashboard creation
Knowledge of statistical modeling and basic machine learning
I’m currently working as a Junior Project and Services Manager at LOGYCA, where I support retail and supplier metrics analysis, and I’m always up for a new challenge! I’m also a Google-certified data analyst and enjoy expanding my skills with new tools and techniques.
