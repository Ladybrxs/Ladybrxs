## 💫 About Me:

Hey there! I'm *Leidy Rodriguez*, an Industrial Engineer and passionate data enthusiast with a knack for turning numbers into stories. I believe that data has the power to drive smarter decisions, and I’m here to make that happen!

With a background in data analysis and project management, I thrive on finding insights hidden in data and sharing them in a way that’s easy to understand and act on. I love using tools like *Power BI*, *Excel*, *SQL* and *Tableau* to dig deep, spot trends, and help teams see the big picture. Whether it's helping businesses understand their customers or optimizing inventory levels, I’m all about using data to make a difference.

## 🌟 What I bring to the table:

Expertise in Power BI and Excel for data visualization and reporting
Hands-on experience in data validation and dashboard creation
Knowledge of statistical modeling and basic machine learning

I’m currently working as a Junior Project and Services Manager at LOGYCA, where I support retail and supplier metrics analysis, and I’m always up for a new challenge! I’m also a Google-certified data analyst and enjoy expanding my skills with new tools and techniques.

Feel free to connect with me. Let’s turn data into insights together!
